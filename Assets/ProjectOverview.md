# SlashBuild

## Elevator Pitch
Insparation comes from Minecraft, Terraria, Diablo and Roguelikes. The game will be in a fantasy setting akin to Terraria or Diablo and support building like Terraria or Minecraft. The maps and enemies should be generated like a Roguelike game seperated into different rooms constructing a map, but have substance and meaning to build and craft items. Main gamemode will be centered around an constrained map like Terraria's, but could be evolved to also offer traditional roguelike with progressive levels.
